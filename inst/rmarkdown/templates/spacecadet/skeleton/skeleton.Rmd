## Your turn
Your turn! In the blank code chunk below, write code that returns the total number of `NA`s in the `age` column of `kp_rodents`. Notice that you can see the solution (but make sure to try coding it yourself manually first!).

```

```{r exercise_na_miss_1-solution}
table(airquality$Ozone, useNA = "always")
```
