## Welcome!

Welcome to your new `learnr` tutorial! 

Visit https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/ for more information.

See the next sections for examples, exercises and quizzes, then start replacing with your own! 

## Examples

### Example 1

Here is a pre-populated exercise, which uses the `mtcars` dataset: 

```{r ex_1, exercise = TRUE}
max(mtcars$mpg)
```

### Example 2

Here is a blank exercise with a solution.

**Exercise:** Type in code to calculate 5 + 5 below. 

```{r ex_2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ex_2-solution}
5 + 5
```

### Example 3

Here is a blank exercise with a hint.

**Exercise:** Find the mean value of the `qsec` column in `mtcars`.

```{r ex_3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r ex_3-hint, eval = FALSE}
Use '$' to refer to a single column from a data frame.
```


## Questions

You can include questions in your tutorial. 

See https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/questions.html for more information and options.

  answer("10"),
  answer("whale"),
  answer("7", correct = TRUE),
  answer("urchin")
)
```
